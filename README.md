# Transcription-of-video-file-using-API
This is a project which is capable of creating Transcript of video/audio file using assemblyAI API.
The repository consists of colab notebook where I have used AssemblyAI API to create a transcription bot. 
There are several stages in implementing the API. 
The first stage is to initialize the API key. 
The second step consists of installing pytube from YouTube. 
Next stage consists of getting video link of youtube or drive. 
The video file will be converted to audio file. 
The audio file is then fed to model for getting the transcript. 
The transcript file is ready and is displayed to the user.
Next stage is to get the input from the user if it needs to download the transcript file or not. 
The contributors to this repositories are mrrajeev29 and codewithpassion-ninad.
